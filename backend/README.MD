# Backend Development Guidelines

## Choose Your Framework
You can use any backend framework of your choice. Some popular options include:
- Node.js: Express, Koa, Nest.js
- Python: Flask, FastAPI, Django
- Go: Gin, Echo
- Ruby: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra
- Java: Spring Boot
- C#: ASP.NET Core

## Key Components to Implement
Regardless of the framework you choose, make sure to implement the following components:

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement registration and login endpoints
   - Use JWT or OAuth for authentication
   - Create middleware for protected routes

2. **Database Models**
   - User model
   - GPU Listing model
   - Bid model

3. **API Endpoints**
   - User routes (register, login)
   - Listing routes (CRUD operations)
   - Bid routes (create, read, update)

4. **Database Connection**
   - Set up connection to your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implement consistent error handling across your application

7. **Input Validation**
   - Validate incoming data for all API endpoints

## Folder Structure
Organize your code logically. A common structure might include:
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `controllers/`: Business logic
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
- `models/`: Database models
- `routes/`: API route definitions

## Documentation
- Document your API endpoints
- Include setup instructions in your README.md

Remember to choose the tools and structure that best fit your experience and the project requirements. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to create a well-organized, functional backend that supports the marketplace features.
