# GPU Marketplace Full-Stack Application (8-Hour Challenge Version)

This is a basic full-stack GPU Marketplace application, designed to be implemented within an 8-hour timeframe with AI assistance. The technology stack is flexible and up to the developer's choice.

## Project Scope

Given the time constraint, this project focuses on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) with core functionalities. The goal is to demonstrate key full-stack development skills rather than building a fully-featured application.

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Basic User Authentication**
   - Simple registration and login functionality
   - Secure authentication method (e.g., JWT, sessions)

2. **GPU Listings (CRUD Operations)**
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete GPU listings
   - API endpoints for listing operations
   - Frontend interface for managing listings

3. **Basic Bidding Feature**
   - Place bids on listings
   - Display current highest bid for each listing
   - Implement a basic dashboard for users to manage their bids and listings and see latest prices

4. **Minimal but Functional UI**
   - Focus on functionality over advanced styling
   - Ensure all features are accessible and usable

## Technology Stack

The choice of technology stack is entirely up to the developer. Some options include:

### Backend
- Node.js (Express, Koa, Nest.js)
- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Ruby on Rails
- Java (Spring Boot)
- C# (.NET Core)
- Go
- PHP (Laravel)

### Frontend
- React
- Vue.js
- Angular
- Svelte
- Or any other frontend framework/library of choice

### Database
- SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase

## Project Structure

The project structure will depend on the chosen technologies. Generally, it should separate backend and frontend:

```
gpu-marketplace/
├── backend/
│   ├── [Backend framework-specific structure]
├── frontend/
│   ├── [Frontend framework-specific structure]
└── README.md
```

## Setup and Running

Provide clear instructions for:
1. Setting up the development environment
2. Installing dependencies
3. Configuring the database
4. Starting the backend server
5. Starting the frontend development server

## Project Submission

After completing your implementation, please submit your project as follows:

1. **GitHub Repository**
   - Push your code to a public GitHub repository
   - Ensure your repository includes:
     - All source code (backend and frontend)
     - This README with setup instructions
     - Any additional documentation you created

2. **README Updates**
   - Update this README with:
     - Specific technologies you chose and why
     - Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them
     - Features you implemented and any you didn't have time for
     - Instructions for running your application locally

3. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - If possible, deploy your application to a free hosting service (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel)
   - Include the live URL in your README

## Development Approach 

1. Choose and set up your preferred tech stack quickly
2. Implement basic backend structure and database connection
3. Create API endpoints for auth, listings, and bids
4. Set up frontend project and implement basic routing
5. Create UI components for auth, listings, and bidding
6. Connect frontend to backend API
7. Add minimal styling if time permits
8. Throughout: use AI for boilerplate code, debugging, and problem-solving

## Note on AI Usage

While AI can significantly speed up development, it's crucial to:
- Understand all the code you're implementing
- Be prepared to explain your design decisions
- Use AI as a tool to enhance productivity, not as a replacement for skills and knowledge

## Priorities

1. Get a basic end-to-end flow working (user can register, login, create a listing, and place a bid)
2. Ensure data is correctly saved to and retrieved from the database
3. Implement proper error handling for critical operations
4. Focus on functionality over extensive styling or advanced features

Remember, the goal is to create a working full-stack prototype that demonstrates your ability to implement core features effectively within a tight timeframe. Prioritize functionality over perfection, and be prepared to discuss your approach and any trade-offs you made due to time constraints.

Good luck with your challenge!
